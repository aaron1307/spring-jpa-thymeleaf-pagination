# spring-jpa-thymeleaf-pagination

## Spring mvc, Spring Jpa, Spring boot, Hibernate, Thymeleaf

Developed using IntelliJ

This is a mall tutorial about pagination using thymeleaf and spring jpa

In oder to run the project, first configure database parameters in application.properties;

when first time using it go to http://localhost:8080/save when us to create data in the databse for pagination display

after than it will direct automatically to http://localhost:8080/ to display data

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = create is used so when starting the application, data in the table will be erased so

http://localhost:8080/save needs to be called again to forge data in db

THank you!
